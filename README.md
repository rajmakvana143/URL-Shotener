A URL shortener is an app that converts a long URL into a short URL. (app is created using mongo.db , express.js , node.js , mongo.db )

The idea is to minimize the web page address into something that’s easier to remember and track. 
Typically, it shortens the website’s address and adds a random combination of letters and numbers.
